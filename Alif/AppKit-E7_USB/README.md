# SDS Application for Alif AppKit-E7-AIML board with SDSIO using USB Interface

This application demonstrates how to test DSP and ML algorithms using the SDS framework.
It lets you record and play back real-world data streams on physical hardware, feeding
them to your algorithm for testing. The data streams are stored in SDS data files.

## Pre-Requisite

To run this example:

- Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and run a Blinky example on the board to verify tool installation.
- Use `cpackget add ARM::SDS` to add the SDS Framework and [Setup the SDS Python utilities](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server).
- Setup the [Python environment](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup) for running the SDS Utilities.
- Install Alif Ensemble CMSIS DFP pack v2.2.1 or later with:
  - `cpackget add AlifSemiconductor::Ensemble@2.2.1`

## Alif AppKit-E7-AIML board

The [Alif AppKit-E7-AIML](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-appkit-e7-aiml-d1-34b5d51/projects/)
features a dual-core Cortex-M55 each paired with an Ethos-U55 NPU.

Before using this SDS example on the board it is required to program the ATOC of the device using the Alif SETOOLS.  
Refer to the section [Usage](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/ensemble-alifsemiconductor/overview/)
in the overview page of the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble DFP/BSP for information on how to setup
these tools.

In VS Code use the menu command **Terminal - Run Tasks** and execute:

- `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"`

For Windows ensure that the Terminal default is Git Bash or PowerShell.

> Note:
>
> - Configure J15 to position SE (Secure UART) to enable SETOOLS communication with the device.
> - Configure J15 to position U4 (UART4) to see STDIO messages from the application.

## Projects

The `SDS.csolution.yml` application is configured for the targets [AppKit-E7-U55](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-appkit-e7-aiml-d1-34b5d51/projects/) or [SSE-300-U55](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH) FVP simulation models.

It contains two projects:

- **`DataTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies the SDSIO interface on hardware.
- **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies a LiteRT Object Detection (YOLO Fastest) ML model with recording and playback of SDS data files.

## Layer Type: Board and Layer Type: SDSIO

The board layer implements the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) layer. Depending on the selected target, a different board implementation with the appropriate I/O interfaces is used:

- `Board/AppKit-E7_M55_HP/Board_HP.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_usb.clayer.yml` use the development board's **USB interface** for SDSIO communication.
- `Board/Corstone-300/Board-U55.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_fvp.clayer.yml` use the **VSI Interface** to the AVH FVP simulator for SDSIO communication.

## Build Targets

- **`Debug`**: Debug version of the application used for recording/playback of input data and algorithm output data.
- **`Release`**: Release version of the application used for recording/playback of input data and algorithm output data.

> Note: Only difference between `Debug` and `Release` targets is compiler optimization level and the amount of debug information printed to the STDIO.

For more details, refer to the [SDS Template Application](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/template.html).

## DataTest Project on the Alif AppKit-E7-AIML board

The **DataTest** project allows you to verify the SDSIO communication and it is recommended to use this project first.

Build and run this project in VS Code by following these steps:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select:
     - Target type **AppKit-E7-U55**.
     - Project **DataTest** with Build Type **Debug**.
2. Open in VS Code a Terminal window and start the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server) with `sdsio-server usb` .
3. **Build Solution** to create an executable image.
4. Configure **J15** for **UART4 (U4 position)** used for the application output (STDIO).
5. Connect a **USB cable** between the host **PC** and the **PRG USB (J2)** connector on the **AppKit-E7-AIML** board.
6. Connect a second **USB cable** between host **PC** and the **SOC USB (J1)** connector on the **AppKit-E7-AIML** board.
7. Open the VS Code **Serial Monitor** and start monitoring the application output (STDIO) on the J-Link Virtual COM port.
8. **Load Application to Target** to download the application to the board.
9. Reset the board with **RESET (SW1)** button and observe the application output (STDIO) like below

```txt
SDSIO-Client USB interface initialized successfully
99% idle
99% idle
```

alternatively if SDSIO-Server is not reachable or not running you will see the output:

```txt
SDSIO-Client USB interface initialization failed!
Ensure that device is connected via USB to the host PC running SDSIO-Server, then restart the application!
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - If the SDSIO-Server is not found, verify your [SDS Utilities Setup](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup).
> - It is possible to configure the input data bandwidth by editing `ALGO_TEST_BANDWIDTH` define in the `algorithm_config.h` file.
>   Default bandwidth is configured to `100000U` which means approximately 100000 bytes per second.

### Recording/playback testing

For executing the **recording** or **playback** test, follow the steps below:

### Recording

To perform a recording, follow these steps:
- To start recording, press the `R` key in the SDSIO-Server window, or press the **joystick (SW2)** on the board.
- To stop recording, press the `S` key in the SDSIO-Server window, or press the **joystick (SW2)** on the board again.

**Output of SDSIO-Server during recording**

```txt

SDSIO command: stop ('s').
sdsFlags = 0x10000000.
Closed:   Test_In (Test_In.0.sds)
Closed:   Test_Out (Test_Out.0.sds)
```

**Application output in the Serial Monitor**

```txt
99% idle
==== SDS recording started
99% idle
99% idle
==== SDS recording stopped
99% idle
```

Each run records two files: `Test_In.<n>.sds` and `Test_Out.<n>.sds` in the folder where SDSIO-Server was started. `<n>` is a sequential number.

**Check SDS Files**

The [SDS-Check](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sds-check) utility verifies SDS files for consistency. For example:

```bash
>sds-check -i Test_In.0.sds
File Name         : Test_In.0.sds
File Size         : 240.960 bytes
Number of Records : 240
Recording Time    : 2.390 ms
Recording Interval: 10 ms
Data Size         : 239.040 bytes
Block Size        : 996 bytes
Data Rate         : 99.600 byte/s
Jitter            : Not detected
Validation passed
```

### Playback

To perform a playback, follow these steps:
- To start the playback, press the `P` key in the SDSIO-Server window.
- The playback will stop automatically when it plays all the data from the SDS file.

The stream `Test_In.<n>.sds` is read back and the algorithm processes this data.
The stream `Test_Out.<n>.p.sds` is written containing results of the test algorithm.
The SDS file `Test_Out.<n>.p.sds` created during playback should be identical to the `Test_Out.<n>.sds` file created during the recording.

**Output of SDSIO-Server during playback**

> **Notes:**
>
> - The simulator target only supports playback mode.
> - This example includes an `algorithm.sdsio.yml` configuration file that sets `algorithm/SDS Recordings` as the working directory for SDS playback.  
>   To test the previous example, either: copy recorded files `Test_In.0.sds` and `Test_Out.0.sds` into that directory, or update the
>   `workdir` in the `algorithm.sdsio.yml` and change stream names `ML_In` to `Test_In` and `ML_Out` to `Test_Out`.  
>   For details on the **sdsio.yml** configuration format and available options, refer to
>   the [documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-control-file-sdsioyml).
> - The VSI script used by the simulator also generates the `sdsio.log` output file.

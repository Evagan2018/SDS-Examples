# SDS Application for Alif DevKit-E8 board with SDSIO using Ethernet Interface

This application demonstrates how to test DSP and ML algorithms using the SDS framework.
It lets you record and play back real-world data streams on physical hardware, feeding
them to your algorithm for testing. The data streams are stored in SDS data files.

## Pre-Requisite

To run this example:

- Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and run a Blinky example on the board to verify tool installation.
- Use `cpackget add ARM::SDS` to add the SDS Framework and [Setup the SDS Python utilities](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server).
- Setup the [Python environment](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup) for running the SDS Utilities.
- Install Alif Ensemble CMSIS DFP pack v2.2.0 or later with:
  - `cpackget add AlifSemiconductor::Ensemble@2.2.0`

## Alif DevKit-E8 board

The [Alif DevKit-E8](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-devkit-e8-a1-c8b9599/projects/)
features a dual-core Cortex-M55 each paired with an Ethos-U55 NPU.
Ethos-U85 NPU is also available on Alif Ensemble E8 devices.

Before using this SDS example on the board it is required to program the ATOC of the device using the Alif SETOOLS.  
Refer to the section [Usage](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/ensemble-alifsemiconductor/overview/)
in the overview page of the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble DFP/BSP for information on how to setup
these tools.

In VS Code use the menu command **Terminal - Run Tasks** and execute:

- `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"`

For Windows ensure that the Terminal default is Git Bash or PowerShell.

> Note:
>
> - Configure SW4 to position SE (Secure UART) to enable SETOOLS communication with the device.
> - Configure SW4 to position U4 (UART4) to see STDIO messages from the application.
> - Connect MT9M114 camera to the J16 connector on the bottom of the DevKit-E8 board.
> - Connect display to the J21 connector on the top of the DevKit-E8 board.

## Projects

The `SDS.csolution.yml` application is configured for the targets [DevKit-E8-U85](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-devkit-e8-a1-c8b9599/projects/) or [SSE-320-U85](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH) FVP simulation models.

It contains two projects:

- **`DataTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies the SDSIO interface on hardware.
- **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies a LiteRT Object Detection (YOLO Fastest) ML model with recording and playback of SDS data files.

## Layer Type: Board and Layer Type: SDSIO

The board layer implements the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) layer. Depending on the selected target, a different board implementation with the appropriate I/O interfaces is used:

- `Board/DevKit-E8_M55_HP/Board_HP-U85.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_network.clayer.yml` use the development board's **Ethernet interface** for SDSIO communication.
- `Board/Corstone-320/Board-U85.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_fvp.clayer.yml` use the **VSI Interface** to the AVH FVP simulator for SDSIO communication.

## Build Targets

- **`Debug`**: Debug version of the application used for recording/playback of input data and algorithm output data.
- **`Release`**: Release version of the application used for recording/playback of input data and algorithm output data.

> Note: Only difference between `Debug` and `Release` targets is compiler optimization level and the amount of debug information printed to the STDIO.

For more details, refer to the [SDS Template Application](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/template.html).

## DataTest Project on the Alif DevKit-E8 board

The **DataTest** project allows you to verify the SDSIO communication and it is recommended to use this project first.

Build and run this project in VS Code by following these steps:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select:
     - Target type **DevKit-E8-U85**.
     - Project **DataTest** with Build Type **Debug**.
2. Open in VS Code a Terminal window and start the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server) with `sdsio-server socket` .
3. Open `sdsio_client_socket_config.h` and configure **SDSIO_SOCKET_SERVER_IP** to the SDSIO-Server provided IP.
4. **Build Solution** to create an executable image.
5. Configure **SW4** switch for **UART4 (U4 position)** used for the application output (STDIO).
6. Connect a **USB cable** between the host **PC** and the **PRG USB (J3)** connector on the **DevKit-E8** board.
7. Connect an **Ethernet cable** between the **J2 (RJ45)** connector on the **DevKit-E8** board and the same local network that the **PC** is connected to.
8. Open the VS Code **Serial Monitor** and start monitoring the application output (STDIO) on the J-Link Virtual COM port.
9. **Load Application to Target** to download the application to the board.
10. Reset the board with **RESET (SW1)** button and observe the application output (STDIO) like below

```txt
Initializing sockets...
IP address: 192.168.0.144
SDSIO-Client socket interface initialized successfully.
Connection to SDSIO-Server established at 192.168.0.129:5050
99% idle
```

alternatively if SDSIO-Server is not reachable or not running you will see the output:

```txt
Initializing sockets...
IP address: 192.168.0.144
SDSIO-Client socket interface initialization failed or 'sdsio-server socket' unavailable at 192.168.0.129:5050 !
Ensure that SDSIO-Server is running, then restart the application!
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - The SDSIO-Server must be started before the application on the hardware.
> - After restarting the SDSIO-Server, there may be a Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL) timeout during which the operating system cannot immediately reuse
>   the same TCP sockets (typically around 2 minutes, depending on the platform).
>   Therefore, after terminating the SDSIO-Server, it is recommended to wait for this timeout to expire before starting a new instance of the SDSIO-Server.
> - If the SDSIO-Server is not found, verify your [SDS Utilities Setup](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup).
> - IP address 192.168.0.129 serves as example - it will be different on your local network.
> - It is possible to configure the input data bandwidth by editing `ALGO_TEST_BANDWIDTH` define in the `algorithm_config.h` file.
>   Default bandwidth is configured to `100000U` which means approximately 100000 bytes per second.

### Recording/playback testing

For executing the **recording** or **playback** test, follow the steps below:

### Recording

To perform a recording, follow these steps:
- To start recording, press the `R` key in the SDSIO-Server window, or press the **joystick (SW2)** on the board.
- To stop recording, press the `S` key in the SDSIO-Server window, or press the **joystick (SW2)** on the board again.

**Output of SDSIO-Server during recording**

```txt

SDSIO command: start recording ('R').
sdsFlags = 0x90000000.
Record:   Test_In (Test_In.0.sds)
Record:   Test_Out (Test_Out.0.sds)
SDSIO command: stop ('s').
sdsFlags = 0x10000000.
Closed:   Test_In (Test_In.0.sds)
Closed:   Test_Out (Test_Out.0.sds)
```

**Application output in the Serial Monitor**

```txt
99% idle
==== SDS recording started
99% idle
99% idle
==== SDS recording stopped
99% idle
```

Each run records two files: `Test_In.<n>.sds` and `Test_Out.<n>.sds` in the folder where SDSIO-Server was started. `<n>` is a sequential number.

**Check SDS Files**

The [SDS-Check](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sds-check) utility verifies SDS files for consistency. For example:

```bash
>sds-check -i Test_In.0.sds
File Name         : Test_In.0.sds
File Size         : 240.960 bytes
Number of Records : 240
Recording Time    : 2.390 ms
Recording Interval: 10 ms
Data Size         : 239.040 bytes
Block Size        : 996 bytes
Data Rate         : 99.600 byte/s
Jitter            : Not detected
Validation passed
```

### Playback

To perform a playback, follow these steps:
- To start the playback, press the `P` key in the SDSIO-Server window.
- The playback will stop automatically when it plays all the data from the SDS file.

The stream `Test_In.<n>.sds` is read back and the algorithm processes this data.
The stream `Test_Out.<n>.p.sds` is written containing results of the test algorithm.
The SDS file `Test_Out.<n>.p.sds` created during playback should be identical to the `Test_Out.<n>.sds` file created during the recording.

**Output of SDSIO-Server during playback**

## DataTest Project on the AVH-FVP Simulator

The **DataTest** can be also executed on [AVH-FVP](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH) simulation models using the steps below:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select:
     - Target type **SSE-320-U85**.
     - Project **DataTest** with Build Type **Debug**.
2. **Build Solution** to create an executable image.
3. **Load and Run** starts the application on the AVH-FVP simulation. The output is shown in the Terminal console.

> **Notes:**
>
> - The simulator target only supports playback mode.
> - This example includes an `algorithm.sdsio.yml` configuration file that sets `algorithm/SDS Recordings` as the working directory for SDS playback.  
>   To test the previous example, either: copy recorded files `Test_In.0.sds` and `Test_Out.0.sds` into that directory, or update the
>   `workdir` in the `algorithm.sdsio.yml` and change stream names `ML_In` to `Test_In` and `ML_Out` to `Test_Out`.  
>   For details on the **sdsio.yml** configuration format and available options, refer to
>   the [documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-control-file-sdsioyml).
> - The VSI script used by the simulator also generates the `sdsio.log` output file.

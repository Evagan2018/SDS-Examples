# SDS-Examples

This repository contains examples that show the usage of the [Synchronous Data Streaming (SDS) Framework](https://github.com/ARM-software/SDS-Framework).


## Quick Start

1. Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) from the
   VS Code marketplace.
2. Clone this Git repository into a VS Code workspace.
3. Open the [CMSIS View](https://mdk-packs.github.io/vscode-cmsis-solution-docs/userinterface.html#2-main-area-of-the-cmsis-view)
   in VS Code and use the ... menu to choose an example via *Select Active Solution from workspace*.
4. The related tools and software packs are downloaded and installed. Review progress with *View - Output - CMSIS Solution*.
5. In the CMSIS view, use the
   [Action buttons](https://github.com/ARM-software/vscode-cmsis-csolution?tab=readme-ov-file#action-buttons) to build,
   load and debug the example on the hardware.


## Examples description

The SDS examples are configured for various Evaluation Boards and use the [MDK-Middleware](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/mdk-middleware-keil/overview/) for the [SDSIO Interface](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/sdsio.html). New hardware targets can be added using board layers that provide the required API interfaces.
The examples are configured for [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://www.keil.arm.com/).
Run a blinky example for the related board first to verify tool installation.
> IMPORTANT
>
> - Each example has a local VS Code configuration. Use in VS Code **Open Folder** to open the folder of each project individually.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

The repository uses [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows) to test project build with AC6 and GCC and execute algorithm tests.
Refer to [Understanding GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions) and [Arm FVPs](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/infrastructure/html/avh_gh_actions.html) documentation for more information.

# SDS Application for ST B-U585I-IOT02A board with SDSIO using USB Interface

This application is an example of using [**Edge Impulse Keyword Spotting ML algorithm**](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/547356/live) on a physical board.
It lets you record and play back real-world data streams on physical hardware, feeding
them to your algorithm for testing. The data streams are stored in SDS data files.

## Pre-Requisite

To run this example:

- Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and run a Blinky example on the board to verify tool installation.
- Use `cpackget add ARM::SDS` to add the SDS Framework and [Setup the SDS Python utilities](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server).
- Setup the [Python environment](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup) for running the SDS Utilities.

## ST B-U585I-IOT02A board

The [ST B-U585I-IOT02A](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/stmicroelectronics-b-u585i-iot02a-revc-c3bc599/) board is based on a Cortex-M33 processor. For using the integrated ST-Link install the [ST-Link USB driver](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html) or your computer and update the firmware.

## Projects

The `SDS.csolution.yml` application is configured for the targets [B-U585I-IOT02A](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/stmicroelectronics-b-u585i-iot02a-revc-c3bc599/guide/) or [SSE-300-U55](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH) FVP simulation models.

It contains two projects:

- **`DataTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies the SDSIO interface on hardware.
- **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies a Keyword Spotting ML algorithm with recording and playback of SDS data files.

## Layer Type: Board and Layer Type: SDSIO

The board layer implements the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) layer. Depending on the selected target, a different board implementation with the appropriate I/O interfaces is used:

- `Board/B-U585I-IOT02A/Board.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_usb.clayer.yml` use the development board's **USB interface** for SDSIO communication.
- `Board/Corstone-300/Board-U55.clayer.yml` and `sdsio_fvp.clayer.yml` use the **VSI Interface** to the AVH FVP simulator for SDSIO communication.

## Layer Type: Edge Impulse layer

This layer contains the ML model that is used in the `AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`.

#### ML Model update procedure

1.  **Clone the project**  
    Clone the [**Tutorial: Responding to your voice**](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/547356/live)
    project from Edge Impulse.
2.  **Build CMSIS pack**  
    - Under **Time series data, Spectral Analysis, Classification, Anomaly Detection (K-means)**, select **Deployment**.

- **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies a Keyword Spotting ML algorithm with recording (on hardware only) and playback of SDS data files.

## Build Targets

- **`Debug`**: Debug version of the application used for recording/playback of input data and algorithm output data.
- **`Release`**: Release version of the application used for recording/playback of input data and algorithm output data.

> Note: Only difference between `Debug` and `Release` targets is compiler optimization level and the amount of debug information printed to the STDIO.

For more details, refer to the [SDS Template Application](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/template.html).

## DataTest Project on the ST B-U585I-IOT02A board

The **DataTest** project allows you to verify the SDSIO communication and it is recommended to use this project first.

Build and run this project in VS Code by following these steps:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select:
     - Target type **B-U585I-IOT02A**.
     - Project **DataTest** with Build Type **Debug**.
2. Open in VS Code a Terminal window and start the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server) with `sdsio-server usb` .
3. **Build Solution** to create an executable image.
4. Connect a **USB cable** between the host **PC** and the **STLK (CN8)** USB connector on the **B-U585I-IOT02A** board.
5. Connect a second **USB cable** between host **PC** and the **USB-C (CN1)** connector on the **B-U585I-IOT02A** board.
6. Open the VS Code **Serial Monitor** and start monitoring the application output (STDIO) on the STLink Virtual COM port.
7. **Load and Run** to download the application to the board and start it.
8. Observe the application output (STDIO) like below

```txt
SDSIO-Client USB interface initialized successfully
99% idle
99% idle
```

alternatively if SDSIO-Server is not reachable or not running you will see the output:

```txt
SDSIO-Client USB interface initialization failed!
Ensure that device is connected via USB to the host PC running SDSIO-Server, then restart the application!
```

> **Note:**
>
> - If the SDSIO-Server is not found, verify your [SDS Utilities Setup](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup).
> - It is possible to configure the input data bandwidth by editing `ALGO_TEST_BANDWIDTH` define in the `algorithm_config.h` file.
>   Default bandwidth is configured to `100000U` which means approximately 100000 bytes per second.

### Recording/playback testing

For executing the **recording** or **playback** test, follow the steps below:

### Recording

To perform a recording, follow these steps:
- To start recording, press the `R` key in the SDSIO-Server window, or press the **User** button on the board.
- To stop recording, press the `S` key in the SDSIO-Server window, or press the **User** button on the board again.

**Output of SDSIO-Server during recording**

```

**Application output in the Serial Monitor**

```txt
99% idle
==== SDS recording started
98% idle
98% idle
==== SDS recording stopped
99% idle
```

Each run records two files: `Test_In.<n>.sds` and `Test_Out.<n>.sds` in the folder where SDSIO-Server was started. `<n>` is a sequential number.

**Check SDS Files**

The [SDS-Check](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sds-check) utility verifies SDS files for consistency. For example:

```bash
>sds-check -i Test_In.0.sds
File Name         : Test_In.0.sds
File Size         : 271.080 bytes
Number of Records : 270
Recording Time    : 2.690 ms
Recording Interval: 10 ms
Data Size         : 268.920 bytes
Block Size        : 996 bytes
Data Rate         : 99.600 byte/s
Jitter            : Not detected
Validation passed
```

### Playback

To perform a playback, follow these steps:
- To start the playback, press the `P` key in the SDSIO-Server window.
- The playback will stop automatically when it plays all the data from the SDS file.

The stream `Test_In.<n>.sds` is read back and the algorithm processes this data.
The stream `Test_Out.<n>.p.sds` is written containing results of the test algorithm.
The SDS file `Test_Out.<n>.p.sds` created during playback should be identical to the `Test_Out.<n>.sds` file created during the recording.

**Output of SDSIO-Server during playback**
